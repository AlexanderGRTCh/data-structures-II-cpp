# Undirected Graph Analyzer (C++)

This project implements a class-based undirected graph system in C++, with support for vertex and edge tracking, degree analysis, pathfinding, cycle detection, and multiple display formats. It includes a randomized adjacency matrix generator for demo purposes.

## Files

- `Graph.h` â€“ Graph class with adjacency list, edge list, and all core algorithms.
- `testGraph.cpp` â€“ Driver to test all graph features on a randomly generated matrix.

## ğŸ”§ Features

- ğŸ”¹ Graph creation from adjacency matrix  
- ğŸ”¹ Adjacency list and edge list construction  
- ğŸ”¹ Vertex and edge count functions  
- ğŸ”¹ Neighbor and degree analysis (with sorted output)  
- ğŸ”¹ Pathfinding via DFS  
- ğŸ”¹ Cycle detection using DFS traversal  
- ğŸ”¹ Clean console output for all operations  

## ğŸ§ª Example Usage

```bash
g++ testGraph.cpp -o graph
./graph
